# rocksdb - real persistent engine (self-concurrent).
#
# Defaults target the system v11 install: headers under /usr/include/rocksdb and
# librocksdb.so.11 on the default library search path.
#
# The header pin needs care when a second rocksdb sits under /usr/local, since
# /usr/local/include is searched ahead of /usr/include and its headers shadow the
# v11 ones. A plain -I/usr/include does not fix that. The compiler drops any -I
# naming a directory already on its standard search path, keeping the standard
# order, so the flag is silently ignored, the shadow still wins, and the build
# compiles the older headers against the v11 library while the report prints the
# v11 version read from ROCKSDB_VERSION_H. Stage a private include root holding a
# single rocksdb symlink instead and point -I at that. It is not a standard
# directory, so it is honoured and lands ahead of /usr/local/include.
#
# Override for a custom install, e.g.:
#   make ROCKSDB=1 ROCKSDB_CFLAGS=-I/opt/rocksdb/include \
#                  ROCKSDB_LIBS="-L/opt/rocksdb/lib -lrocksdb" \
#                  ROCKSDB_VERSION_H=/opt/rocksdb/include/rocksdb/version.h
# Overriding ROCKSDB_CFLAGS leaves the staged root unused, so a custom prefix
# needs no knowledge of it.
# ROCKSDB_PREFIX points the whole build at one self-contained install, which is
# what install_rocksdb.sh --prefix produces. It derives the three variables below,
# and the rpath matters as much as the -L: -L only steers the link, so without it
# the loader can still hand the process a different build of the same soname and
# the report would name a version that never ran.
#   make ROCKSDB=1 ROCKSDB_PREFIX=/opt/engines/rocksdb-11.8.1
